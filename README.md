## Frequently Asked Questions

### Requirements
- Latest version of OWML.
- Latest version of Mod Manager. (If using)
- Latest version of Outer Wilds. (Epic version preferred, as Steam version is untestable.)
- Fast and stable internet connection, upload and download.
- Should be able to run on minimum Outer Wilds system requirements.

### What is currently synced?
QSB does not operate on a strict server-client relationship. Each player's game is left as a completely seperate game, and individual elemets are synced or patched so they can be controlled though network messages. Right now, the list of synced objects are :
- Geysers
- Elevators
- Nomai interface orbs
- Player animations
- Player tools
- Player ships
- Player probes
- NPC heads in conversations
- Ship log
- Discovering frequencies / signals
- Nomai text (Spirals + Computers)

QSB also changes some mechanics of the base game, to better fit a multiplayer experience. These include :
- Adding dialogue boxes above NPC and player heads, so other players can "listen in" on conversations.
- Quantum objects check observations from all players and all player probes.

### Why can't I connect to a server?
#### For the host :
- Open port 7777 TCP and UDP on your router. If access the internet through multiple layers of routers, the port will need to be opened on every router.
- Open port 7777 TCP and UDP in and out on your firewall. Some AVs might block you editing firewall settings, so check with your specific software.
- Make sure you are giving your public IPv4 address to your clients.
#### For the client :
- Open port 7777 TCP and UDP in and out on your firewall. Some AVs might block you editing firewall settings, so check with your specific software.
- Sometimes, it has helped to change your network profile to "private".
- Make sure you are putting the right address into the address box.

If nothing here works, many people have got QSB working through programs such as Hamachi. Also make sure you are not running through a VPN while trying to connect.

## Installation

### Easy installation (recommended)

- [Install the Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-manager#how-do-i-use-this);
- Install Quantum Space Buddies from the mod list displayed in the application;
- If you can't get the mod manager to work, follow the instructions for manual installation.

### Manual installation

- [Install OWML](https://github.com/amazingalek/owml#installation);
- [Download the latest Quantum Space Buddies release](https://github.com/misternebula/quantum-space-buddies/releases/latest);
- Extract the `QSB` directory to the `OWML/Mods` directory;
- Run `OWML.Launcher.exe` to start the game.

## Playing as a client

- Run the game;
- You'll see some new buttons on the top left;
- Replace `localhost` with the server's public IP address;
- Press "Connect". You can join servers in the menu or in-game, but it is recommended to join in the main menu.";
- If you see "Stop", you are connected.
- If it stops at "Connecting to..." then you or the host has issues with their firewall/router/other.

## Playing as a host

- Open port `7777` on your router.;
- Run the game.;
- You'll see some new buttons on the top left.;
- Press "Host". This can be done in-game or in the menu, but it is recommened to start servers in the menu.;
- If you now see the "Stop" button, you are hosting.;
- Give your external IPv4 address to your clients ([like what you see here](http://whatismyip.host/)).

## Development Setup

- [Download the Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://github.com/misternebula/ow*mod*manager) and install it anywhere you like;
- Install OWML using the Mod Manager;
- Clone QSB's source;
- Open the file `QSB/QSB.csproj.user` in your favorite text editor;
- Edit the entry `<GameDir>` to point to the directory where Outer Wilds is installed;
- Edit the entry `<OwmlDir>` to point to your OWML directory (it is installed inside the Mod Manager directory);
- Open the project solution file `QSB.sln` in Visual Studio;
- If needed, right click `References` in the Solution Explorer > Manage NuGet Packages > Update OWML to fix missing references;
- Run this to stop tracking QSB.csproj.user: ```git update-index --skip-worktree QSB/QSB.csproj.user```

After doing this, the project references should be working. When you build the solution, the dll and json files will be copied to `[Mod Manager directory]/OWML/QSB`. If this process is successful, you should see the mod show up in the Mod Manager.

If for some reason none of this is working, you might have to set everything manually:

- To fix the references, right*click "References" in the Solution Explorer > "Add Reference", and add all the missing DLLs (references with yellow warning icon). You can find these DLLs in the game's directory (`OuterWilds\OuterWilds_Data\Managed`);
- If Visual Studio isn't able to automatically copy the files, you'll have to copy the built dlls manually to OWML.
